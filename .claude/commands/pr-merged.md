# PR Merged

PR was merged. Remove the branch (locally and remotely), the working tree if you used it, the todo file if it was present. Close PR review comment threads if any were left open.

## Behavior

1. Remove the branch locally and remotely
2. Remove the working tree if it was used
3. Remove the todo file if it was present
4. Close any open PR review comment threads (conversations started by reviewers)
